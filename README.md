## Introduction
* Mastering conditional statements in Python is crucial for decision-making in programming. Conditions allow the code to react dynamically based on different inputs, making applications more flexible and efficient.
* This collection covers everything from simple if-else structures to advanced decision-making techniques, ensuring a solid grasp of Python's control flow.
* Each approach demonstrates practical implementations of conditions, helping to develop problem-solving skills and logical reasoning.

### [Python Basic If-Else](https://github.com/RadhikaDeshpande1010/Python-Conditions-and-If-statements/blob/main/Conditional%20Statements_SRC/Python%20Basic%20If-Else.md)
This section introduces fundamental conditional statements, including:
- if, else, and elif structures
- Boolean expressions and comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, etc.)
- Basic logical operations using conditions
Ideal for beginners looking to understand how decision-making works in Python.

<h4>Python Intermediate Conditional Logic</h4>
Here, conditional logic expands to cover:
- Logical operators (and, or, not) for complex conditions
- Nested conditions for multi-step decision-making
- Using conditions within loops and functions
Perfect for those looking to refine their understanding of structured logic.

<h4>Python Advanced Decision Structures</h4>
Advanced techniques for efficient decision-making, including:
- Ternary operators for concise conditional statements
- Lambda expressions incorporating conditional logic
- Short-circuit evaluation for optimized conditional execution
Understanding these advanced concepts leads to cleaner, more efficient Python
